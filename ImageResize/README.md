This is a program what can resize all *.jpg images in current folder.

If you want to build it, OpenCV2 is required. (2.4.10 used with VS C++ 2010)

To use it you have to type in command promt:
Resize.exe 50% new_
50% - is a percentage what result size will be.
new_ is a prefix to result file name.
