This is simple program what I've made with my Arduino Mega1280

It is a clock with alarm

All input makes with 3 buttons
1st - switchButtonPIN - switch between Time setting/ Alarm setting
2nd and 3rd - minuteButtonPIN and hourButtonPIN change minutes and hours (of Clock if switchButtonPIN off or alarm otherwise).

When time equal to alarm it switchs the relay and turn on lamp.

In planes, there is to make the same device, but with ATtiny2313 microcontroller.
